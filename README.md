# Racing Fire
A simple game in the making. Using pygame, this game is made to feel like an old arcade game.

To compile on windows, run `python setup.py bdist_msi`
This will be available for linux soon.

# Installation
## On windows:
To install the application, simply download the msi installer. This will create
a shortcut on the desktop. Currently there is no shortcut in the start menu.

To use the portable version, simply unzip it, navigate into the racing_fire folder,
and then double click on main.exe.
